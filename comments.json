Are you expecting the cache to be cleared (i.e. re-created) after each request? What is your UC? Setting the \u003ccode\u003eCacheManageter\u003c/code\u003e bean to request scope will not accomplish that, not unless the \u003ccode\u003eCacheManager\u003c/code\u003e provider implementation also implemented Spring\u0026#39;s lifecycle interfaces. This would be a very expensive operation (recreating caches on each request) depending on the caching provider in use and not even practical in a distributed context using a client/server caching topology as is often the case."},{"comment_id":133531537,"owner":{"user_id":2991440,"account_id":3583855,"reputation":122,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/754b2a5e94b7e5e10c20ff84d6a54cbe?s\u003d256\u0026d\u003didenticon\u0026r\u003dPG\u0026f\u003dy\u0026so-version\u003d2","display_name":"krishnan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2991440/krishnan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1678408232,"post_id":75691108,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"Does annotating with @Lazy help here ?"},{"comment_id":131996643,"owner":{"user_id":20770551,"account_id":27245123,"reputation":31,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a6804f56885f656791cd25b34468eb6c?s\u003d256\u0026d\u003didenticon\u0026r\u003dPG","display_name":"n3cw4rr10r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/20770551/n3cw4rr10r"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1670977567,"post_id":74791588,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"I downloaded the latest from selenium.dev.

The only reason I noticed this issue was because this simple list query was taking several seconds, whereas more complex queries on other tables were happening almost instantly. Once I realized, I knew it would suffer more and more as rows are added because Spring JPA is loading every BLOB into memory even tho they are not used. I found a decent solution for Spring data (posted below) but I think I have an even better one that is pure JPA annotation, I will post tmrw if it works"},{"comment_id":46332264,"owner":{"user_id":1880376,"account_id":2116093,"reputation":1529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1d49eba4341a8c9fba765788df15249?s\u003d256\u0026d\u003didenticon\u0026r\u003dPG","display_name":"Desorder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1880376/desorder"},"reply_to_user":{"user_id":2486805,"account_id":2899822,"reputation":3234,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQsDe.jpg?s\u003d256\u0026g\u003d1","display_name":"jm0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2486805/jm0"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1426320367,"post_id":22007341,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"@jm0 As far as you remember, how many tables had BLOB columns?"},{"comment_id":46283903,"owner":{"user_id":2486805,"account_id":2899822,"reputation":3234,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQsDe.jpg?s\u003d256\u0026g\u003d1","display_name":"jm0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2486805/jm0"},"reply_to_user":{"user_id":1880376,"account_id":2116093,"reputation":1529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1d49eba4341a8c9fba765788df15249?s\u003d256\u0026d\u003didenticon\u0026r\u003dPG","display_name":"Desorder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1880376/desorder"},"edited":false,"score":13,"creation_date":1426193992,"post_id":22007341,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"@Desorder -- the cost is not always the same.

I\u0026#39;d recommend adding what you want to a CRM management class that allows different access based on roles for groups that contain users.  Get the API for the CRM right and worry about the access later.  UML and design doesn\u0026#39;t care about implementation language.  I\u0026#39;d also get the object model right with a text UI.  You can add a GUI later when that\u0026#39;s working."},{"comment_id":134505656,"owner":{"user_id":3368818,"account_id":4104221,"reputation":3683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5EJGg.png?s\u003d256\u0026g\u003d1","display_name":"Woodchuck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3368818/woodchuck"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1684342655,"post_id":76265506,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"Posting your code may lead to more helpful responses.

You optimize with more executors. Say you have 16G of RAM on each node for example (m5.xlarge). Then you can run, say 3-4 executors with 3-4G each. Then if you have 2 spark workers, you can run 6-8 total executors, or even more with 1-2G GB per executor. Each file is less than 2MB, so you really don\u0026#39;t need GB of memory"},{"comment_id":134488136,"owner":{"user_id":2423906,"account_id":2819940,"reputation":11881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rkpYv.jpg?s\u003d256\u0026g\u003d1","display_name":"SedJ601","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2423906/sedj601"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1684247113,"post_id":76262714,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"You should probably be using something like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX\" rel\u003d\"nofollow noreferrer\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eTestFX\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for \u003ccode\u003eJavaFX\u003c/code\u003e \u003ccode\u003eGUI\u003c/code\u003e testing."},{"comment_id":134488086,"owner":{"user_id":20842166,"account_id":27329849,"reputation":13,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8d552c521d050b3e5e0b5a4033fd8be?s\u003d256\u0026d\u003didenticon\u0026r\u003dPG","display_name":"steeveKA1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/20842166/steeveka1"},"reply_to_user":{"user_id":209103,"account_id":72426,"reputation":555214,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s\u003d256\u0026d\u003didenticon\u0026r\u003dPG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1684246984,"post_id":76260725,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"@FrankvanPuffelen thank you.
